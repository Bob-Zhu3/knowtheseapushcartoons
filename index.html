The cartoonist's message is that the U.S. opened the doors to China to the other nations across the globe. Can also be interpreted as the U.S is keeping other countries out of China." class="thumbnail">
      <img src="https://hti.osu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/100/public/RedScare_50.jpg?itok=_PwnMXxG" alt="&quot;We Can't Digest the Scum&quot; (1919): After World War I, the U.S. experienced an economic recession and labor strikes. The Russian Revolution fueled a &quot;red scare,&quot; causing fear of radical immigrants and home-grown revolutionaries. Concerns arose about immigrant assimilation, contradicting the idea of the &quot;melting pot.&quot;" class="thumbnail">
      <img src="https://hti.osu.edu/sites/default/files/Immigration_5.jpg" alt="&quot;Looking Backward&quot; (1893): In the 1880s, immigration to the US changed dramatically. Fewer immigrants came from northern and western Europe, while more came from southern and eastern Europe. This shift worried Americans who viewed the new arrivals as inferior. The newcomers were mostly non-Protestant Christians or Jewish, which troubled many Protestant Americans. A cartoon satirically depicts the children of immigrants rejecting new immigrants." class="thumbnail">

An essential point in this cartoon is that the indigenous people of the US and black people are left out of the 'schooling process'. This depiction represents the political agenda of that time, which did not include involving them in political and cultural life at all. Can be connected to the Mexican-American War and the Spanish-American War." class="thumbnail">

The dragon, or hydra, symbolizes the secession of the Confederate states. The faces on the serpent are of major Confederate leaders." class="thumbnail">

      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Benjamin_Franklin_-_Join_or_Die.jpg" alt="&quot;Join, or Die&quot; (1754): Represents the The Albany Plan of Union (a rejected plan to create a unified government for the Thirteen Colonies at the Albany Congress on July 10, 1754 in Albany, New York), comments on the disunity of the Thirteen Colonies during the French and Indian War, and was later used to encourage the colonies to unite for the cause of independence during the American Revolutionary War." class="thumbnail">
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ft-yC+95L._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg" alt="&quot;The Grange Awakening the Sleepers&quot; (1873): A farmer is trying to warn people about a train labeled &quot;consolidation, extortion, and bribery.&quot; The cartoon reflects the activism of the Grange, an agricultural advocacy group founded in 1867. The Grange lobbied for political goals, including the Granger Laws to regulate railroad rates and rural free mail delivery. While the Granger Laws had limited effectiveness, they set an important precedent for state and federal regulation of private enterprise." class="thumbnail">
